/**
 * GET /functions/v1/guardian-status
 *
 * Nucleus's real, external-facing Guardian safety-status API -- the
 * third leg of the octopus-head API trio alongside adjudicate-claim
 * and weaver-score. Answers one question for any arm in the
 * ecosystem: "is it currently safe to keep processing claims?"
 *
 * This exists because guardianRuntime.ts's kill switch is currently
 * only visible from *inside* nucleus -- an arm running its own local
 * calculation engine (DualPay's calculation-engine.ts, for example)
 * has no way to know nucleus's operator flipped the kill switch. This
 * endpoint doesn't change what any arm calculates; it gives them the
 * option to check the same safety signal nucleus's own pipeline
 * already fails closed on, without adopting nucleus's adjudication
 * logic wholesale.
 *
 * Auth: x-api-key header, checked against the same api_clients table
 * adjudicate-claim and weaver-score use. verify_jwt is disabled since
 * callers are other services, not Supabase-authenticated end users.
 *
 * Deliberately read-only: this endpoint cannot activate or deactivate
 * the kill switch -- that stays an operator action inside nucleus's
 * own admin UI, gated to owner/admin roles. An external arm can only
 * ask, never tell.
