/**
 * FIXED (again): the constitution module was restructured since the
 * last fix into a folder exporting a plain data object named
 * "constitution" (lowercase), not a "Constitution" class with a
 * .describe() method -- confirmed by actually running the boot chain,
 * which threw a SyntaxError at this import. Logging the object
 * directly now instead of calling a method that no longer exists
 * anywhere in the new shape.
 */

/**
 * FIXED: previously this file duplicated part of nucleusBoot()'s work
 * manually (calling registerAllSubsystems() directly, constructing its
 * own RuntimeContext and RuntimeHook) without ever calling nucleusBoot()
 * itself -- meaning the "unified boot sequence" it was designed to run
 * never actually ran on real startup. This now calls it directly.
 *
 * KNOWN REMAINING ISSUE (not fixed here, flagging instead of guessing):
 *   RuntimeHook.attachSubsystemHooks() throws "Subsystem identity
 *   violation" whenever ctx.subsystem does not exactly match the
 *   subsystem an event came from. nucleusBoot() constructs a single
 *   NucleusRuntime scoped to ONE subsystem + organizationId. Since
 *   osPipeline.ts needs to dispatch across four different subsystems
 *   (weaver, guardian, glue, dualpay) in a single claim run, either:
 *     (a) nucleusBoot() needs to run once per subsystem (four runtimes),
 *         or
 *     (b) RuntimeHook's identity check needs to allow a "nucleus"-scoped
 *         orchestrator to dispatch on behalf of any subsystem.
 *   This is a real design decision, not a one-line fix -- flagging it
 *   here rather than picking an answer for you.

    // sovereignty/environment/federation/autonomy/resources/lineage/

    // wires adapters in dependency order and runs the constitutional
    // pipeline, instead of that only ever being proven in CI.

    // "Resource Federation Engine (formalized)", #15) had zero real
    // callers -- there was no real topology to register without
    // inventing fake nodes. That data is now real, confirmed rather than
    // guessed (see registerKnownTopology.ts's header): the actual
    // sibling repos, their real (non-)deployment status, and the one
    // link that's genuinely live today (DualPay calling nucleus's real
    // adjudicate-claim Edge Function). Registered before

    // the works) with zero real callers anywhere in the codebase --
    // this is its first one. Every 60s, enqueues + immediately
    // delivers a heartbeat message through nucleusQueue, so both
    // Scheduler and QueueEngine's timer-driven path (not just their
    // request-driven path, already proven by the telemetry wiring)

    // once fires setInterval-driven code is not meaningfully "live,"
    // just imported.

    // Scheduler.register() pattern as the heartbeat above -- its second
    // real caller. Runs certifyNucleus() every 5 minutes so
    // certificationState reflects a real, current sweep instead of only
    // ever whatever the CLI happened to run once (certifyNucleus() is
