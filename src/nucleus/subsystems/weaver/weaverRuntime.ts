   * real, persisted, editable scoring factors (e.g. "high-cost
   * procedure bonus", "known-risky payer penalty") layer on top instead
   * of requiring a code change per new business rule. This is nucleus
   * acting as the ecosystem's decisioning "arm" for real, borrowing the
   * sibling Decision Weaver product's rules/weights design natively
   * rather than depending on that separate, uncredentialed service.
   *
   * Rule-fetch failure fails safe to the base score alone (same
   * behavior as before weaver_rules existed) rather than blocking the
   * claim -- Weaver is an advisory signal, not an authorization gate.
