// The centralized guard contract referenced by subsystemRegistry.ts's
// own header comment ("this file is scoped specifically to what
// RuntimeGuards.enforceSubsystemPermission expects") but never actually
// implemented anywhere in this snapshot -- the same class of gap as the
// missing RuntimeRouter this file's sibling closes.
//
// Scope is deliberately narrow: this owns exactly the enforcement
// OSPipeline.dispatch() used to inline (subsystem exists, subsystem is
// enabled) so there is one place that answers "is this subsystem
// allowed to run right now," not a broader ACL/role system -- org-level
// authorization is Guardian's own job as the authorization *stage* of
// the claim (see guardianRuntime.ts), a different concern from whether
// a subsystem is registered and switched on at all.
