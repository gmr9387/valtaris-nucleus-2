// Phase 26 — Contract Definition
//
// Two designs have accreted onto this one interface: the original
// subsystem/capability/resources-bound shape (still used by
// validateContract() below and its adapter/runtimeGuards callers), and
// the invariant/validate/compatibleWith shape every real
// src/nucleus/contracts/*Contract.ts file actually builds. Both are
// optional here rather than picking one, since real callers depend on
// each independently -- see runtimeGuards.ts's own stopgap comment for
// why the two were never reconciled.
